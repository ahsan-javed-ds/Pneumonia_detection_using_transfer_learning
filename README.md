# Pneumonia Detection Using Transfer Learning
Comparative Analysis of Multiple Transfer Learning Models for Pneumonia Detection

This repository evaluates the performance of multiple Transfer Learning models (`ResNet-50 V2`, `EfficientNet V1 B0`, `EfficientNet V2 B0`, and `Inception V3`) alongside a CNN model for Pneumonia diagnosis using an image-based dataset from **UC San Diego**. By comparing these models, the study aims to identify the most accurate model to streamline Pneumonia diagnosis, contributing valuable insights for future image-based medical analysis. Contributions include detailed comparisons and practical applications of `Inception V3` and other models to aid Radiology professionals in accurate diagnosis.
